Spring knight is a 2D Platform game which is inspired by Jump king.

The bandit in the game once used to be a respectful knight who was striped away from his services. So he is now in a dungeon underground and trying to reach the ground and collect the treasure!!

There are two types of jumps 1.Small 2. Long

Time your jumps correctly to ascend the level
